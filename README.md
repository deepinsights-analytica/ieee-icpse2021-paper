This GitHub repository is part of a paper submission to the **10th International Conference on Power Science and Engineering (ICPSE 2021)** held on Oct. 21-23, 2021 in Yildiz Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey (preprint: http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02166). It contains a series of five freely available Python Jupyter notebooks with code examples. The code was used to get the prediction results described within the ICPSE paper. The dataset used for training and validation of the neural network along with this study is available via the Fraunhofer Fordatis database (https://fordatis.fraunhofer.de/handle/fordatis/215). This dataset contains energy consumption values of 499 anonymized customers located in Spain for the year 2019 in hourly resolution. In addition, temperature values corresponding to the zip code-exact location of each customer was part of the dataset. Both, the Python code and the data, allow all interested engineers, data scientists, and Machine Learning / Deep Learning / AI freaks to check the prediction results described in the IEEE paper and to supplement their own analyzes. We look forward to your comments and suggestions for improvements.
